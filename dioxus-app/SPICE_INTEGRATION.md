# SPICE Client Integration

This document describes the integration of the improved spice-client library into the dioxus-app.

## Key Improvements Integrated

### 1. **Proper Protocol Implementation**
- ✅ Uses the actual spice-client library instead of raw WebSocket
- ✅ Full SPICE protocol support with proper message handling
- ✅ Multi-channel architecture (Main, Display, Inputs, Cursor)
- ✅ Proper authentication flow with RSA-OAEP support

### 2. **Display Handling**
- ✅ Image decoding support for multiple formats:
  - BITMAP (uncompressed)
  - LZ4 compression
  - JPEG
  - Zlib compression
- ✅ Proper surface management with multiple monitor support
- ✅ Drawing command support (DrawFill, DrawCopy, DrawOpaque, DrawBlend)
- ✅ Efficient canvas rendering with format conversion

### 3. **Input Support**
- ✅ Full keyboard input with keycode mapping
- ✅ Mouse movement with coordinate scaling
- ✅ Mouse button events (left, middle, right)
- ✅ Mouse wheel support
- ✅ Proper event handling with preventDefault

### 4. **Connection Management**
- ✅ Proper WebSocket URL construction
- ✅ Password authentication support
- ✅ Connection state tracking
- ✅ Error handling and reporting
- ✅ Clean disconnect on unmount

### 5. **Performance Optimizations**
- ✅ Efficient image data conversion (RGB to RGBA)
- ✅ Canvas size management
- ✅ Event throttling for mouse movements
- ✅ Proper memory management

## Architecture

### SpiceClientWrapper (`spice_client_wrapper.rs`)
- Wraps the spice-client library for easy integration
- Handles message routing between UI and SPICE protocol
- Manages connection lifecycle
- Provides display update callbacks

### SpiceViewer Component (`spice_viewer.rs`)
- Modern React-style component with hooks
- Full keyboard and mouse input handling
- Canvas rendering with proper scaling
- Connection status display
- Error handling and recovery

### Integration Points
1. **VM Console** - Uses SpiceViewer for SPICE protocol connections
2. **Display Updates** - Callback system for efficient canvas updates
3. **Input Handling** - Direct event capture from canvas element
4. **Status Reporting** - Real-time connection status updates

## Usage

The new SPICE viewer is automatically used when:
1. A VM is configured with SPICE display protocol
2. The user opens the console view
3. A WebSocket proxy is available at the specified port

## Benefits Over Previous Implementation

1. **Protocol Compliance** - Properly implements SPICE protocol
2. **Feature Complete** - Supports all major SPICE features
3. **Better Performance** - Efficient image decoding and rendering
4. **Input Support** - Full keyboard and mouse functionality
5. **Error Handling** - Proper error reporting and recovery
6. **Future Proof** - Easy to add new features like audio, USB, clipboard

## Testing

To test the SPICE integration:
1. Configure a VM with SPICE display
2. Start the VM
3. Open the console view
4. Verify keyboard and mouse input work correctly
5. Check that display updates are smooth
6. Test connection/disconnection scenarios
